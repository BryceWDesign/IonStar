## Assembly Steps

### Step 1: Frame Preparation
- Cut carbon fiber sheets according to CAD blueprints.
- Assemble the frame panels using fasteners from the kit.
- Double-check alignment and rigidity.

### Step 2: Mount Electronics
- Secure flight controller board inside the central cavity.
- Attach ion thrusters to the four corners, ensuring correct orientation.
- Fix ambient energy harvesters on exposed surfaces facing potential energy sources.

### Step 3: Wiring Harness
- Cut and strip wires according to the wiring diagram in `schematics/`.
- Solder connectors to wires where necessary.
- Route wires through the frameâ€™s built-in channels.
- Use heat shrink tubing to insulate exposed connections.

### Step 4: Power System Integration
- Connect battery packs to power distribution board.
- Connect thrusters and controllers to power outputs.
- Install any necessary voltage regulators or converters.

### Step 5: Sensor Installation
- Mount IMU and other sensors on vibration-dampened mounts.
- Connect sensors to flight controller ports.

### Step 6: Final System Checks
- Verify all mechanical fasteners are secure.
- Perform continuity tests on all wiring.
- Power up system briefly to check startup sequences.
- Test communication links with ground or VR control station.
