# IonStar

**Next-Generation Autonomous Space Drone**

---

## 🚀 Mission Objective
Design, build, and open-source the world’s most efficient, cost-effective, and perpetually powered autonomous drone for space, Earth flight, and racing conditions—using ambient energy, VR control, and reverse-engineered aerospace logic.

This is not just a drone. This is a Tesla-class engineering challenge:
- Designed for Elon-level missions
- Built by BryceWDesign
- Fueled by community brilliance and zero friction

---

## ⚙️ Key Capabilities
- **Ambient Energy Harvesting:** Power pulled from solar, RF, ion fields, or thermal gradients.
- **Ion Propulsion & Stabilization:** No moving parts required for primary space locomotion.
- **VR Control Integration:** Immersive astronaut/engineer control with real-time telemetry feedback.
- **Earth-Racing Mode:** Retractable prop module deploys on demand for atmospheric environments.
- **Autonomous Ops:** AI-driven stability and mission protocol system (ForgeMind-ready).
