cd IonStar
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
Hardware Assembly and Build Instructions
To build the IonStar drone hardware, follow these detailed steps:

Tools Required
Phillips and flathead screwdrivers

Hex wrenches (sizes per parts list)

Needle nose pliers and tweezers

Medium-strength thread locker

Torque driver (optional)

Step 1: Frame Assembly
Assemble the main drone frame arms to the central hub using provided fasteners.

Use thread locker on screws to prevent loosening from vibrations.

Confirm all screws are securely tightened.

Step 2: Motor Installation
Attach brushless motors to motor mounts on each frame arm.

Secure motors firmly and verify free rotation of motor shafts.

Step 3: Power Distribution Board (PDB)
Mount the PDB at the designated frame location with standoffs.

Ensure isolation from conductive parts to avoid electrical shorts.

Step 4: Flight Controller Installation
Install the flight controller on vibration-damping mounts atop the PDB.

Verify orientation matches software configuration (forward-facing).

Step 5: Wiring
Route wiring neatly along arms, securing with zip ties or clips.

Connect motors, sensors, and power lines to the PDB and flight controller per schematic.

Step 6: Propeller Attachment
Install propellers according to motor rotation direction.

Secure with safety washers and nuts.

Step 7: Final System Checks
Inspect all mechanical and electrical connections.

Balance droneâ€™s center of gravity.

Power on system and verify sensor and motor responses.
