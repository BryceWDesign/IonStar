# IonStar Electrical Wiring Guide

This guide details the wiring and electrical assembly of the IonStar drone. Follow all safety precautions when handling electronics.

## 1. Required Tools and Materials

- Soldering iron and solder
- Heat shrink tubing
- Wire cutters and strippers
- Multimeter
- Electrical tape
- Connectors and cables as specified in parts list

## 2. Wiring the Power Distribution Board (PDB)

- Connect the battery input terminals to the PDB battery pads, ensuring correct polarity.
- Solder power leads securely and cover solder joints with heat shrink tubing.
- Connect ESC power cables to the PDB output pads as per wiring diagram.
- Double-check all connections with a multimeter.

## 3. Connecting the Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)

- Solder motor phase wires from each ESC to the respective motor wires (A, B, C).
- Connect ESC signal wires to the flight controller PWM outputs.
- Route ESC power and signal cables neatly to minimize interference.

## 4. Flight Controller Wiring

- Connect the flight controller to the PDB power output using supplied cables.
- Attach ESC signal and ground wires to flight controller PWM input pins.
- Connect telemetry, GPS, or additional sensors as required.

## 5. Sensor Wiring

- Wire any onboard sensors (e.g., IMU, barometer) according to the sensor datasheets and flight controller inputs.
- Use shielded cables where necessary to reduce noise.

## 6. Battery and Power Switch

- Install the battery connector securely.
- Add an inline fuse or circuit breaker between battery and PDB for safety.
- Connect the power switch wiring as per electrical schematic.

## 7. Final Inspection

- Verify all solder joints are clean and insulated.
- Check for correct polarity on all power connections.
- Secure wiring bundles with zip ties to prevent movement.
