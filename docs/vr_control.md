# IonStar VR Remote Control Interface

This file outlines IonStar’s VR-based drone control system, allowing full remote piloting and observation in deep space via minimal-bandwidth channels.

## 🎮 Overview

Operators can control the drone using a VR headset (e.g. Quest, Vive, or Apple Vision Pro) with real-time sensory feedback, camera streams, and HUD overlays.

## 🔌 Core Features

- **Low-Latency Dual Cam Feed:**  
  Forward-facing and rear-facing cameras streamed with spatial depth interpolation.

- **Orientation Mapping:**  
  Gyroscope + accelerometer tracking synced to thruster vector control.

- **Haptic Feedback Loop:**  
  Optional haptic controller support tied to drone motion and obstacle collisions.

- **Offline Simulation Mode:**  
  Use local physics sim to train before space deployment.  
  Head movement + hand controls simulate real orbital inputs.

## 🌐 Communication Modes

- **Short-Range:**  
  UHF or laser comms for LEO missions or mothership proximity.

- **Long-Range:**  
  Interplanetary control supported via predictive algorithms and buffer relays.

- **Failover:**  
  Autopilot engages if control signal is lost, then auto-reconnects to pilot node.

## 🧠 Future Development

- Neural intent input integration  
- Astronaut EVA assist control  
- Onboard AI partner syncing with pilot gestures  

> System designed to be modular, lightweight, and easily adapted to next-gen headset APIs.
