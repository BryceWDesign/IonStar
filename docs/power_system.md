# IonStar Ambient Power System

This document details the architecture and theoretical basis for IonStar's infinite-flight power source derived from ambient space energy.

## ⚡ Core Concept

IonStar uses a multi-stage energy harvester built into the frame structure:

1. **Triboelectric Nano-Layer Mesh:**  
   Converts micrometeorite collisions and space dust friction into charge.

2. **Radiant Energy Absorber Array:**  
   Thin-film surface layers absorb solar, cosmic, and background microwave radiation.

3. **Supercap Energy Well:**  
   High-cycle graphene capacitors store harvested charge for real-time motor demands.

4. **Active Regulation Layer:**  
   Manages trickle flow to subsystems with minimal leakage loss.

## 🔁 Self-Sustainability

- Operates without solar panel orientation
- Works in eclipse or shadow environments
- No chemical fuel; full electric resilience
- Internal heat converters regulate panel output drift

## 🔋 Energy Use Priority Hierarchy

1. Flight Stabilization IMU
2. VR Control + Feedback Loop
3. Thrust Array Pulse Circuits
4. Telemetry / Beacon Pings

## 🧪 Future Testing Targets

- Ion dispersal self-cleaning for debris
- Magnetron-based deep particle harvest
- Helium ion recoiling for deep-space thrust loop

## 📎 Notes

- Entire system is repairable mid-mission using modular plug-in nodes
- Power metrics are collected via onboard diagnostics for training AI autopilot

> Draft version – continuous improvements as prototypes evolve.
