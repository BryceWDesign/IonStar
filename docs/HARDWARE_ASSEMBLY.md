# IonStar Hardware Assembly Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions to physically assemble the IonStar drone from components.

## Tools Required

- Phillips and flathead screwdrivers
- Hex wrenches (sizes specified in parts list)
- Needle nose pliers
- Tweezers
- Thread locker (medium strength)
- Torque driver (optional)

## Step 1: Frame Assembly

1. Lay out all frame parts and fasteners.
2. Attach main frame arms to the central hub using provided screws and nuts.
3. Tighten all fasteners evenly to ensure structural integrity.
4. Apply thread locker to screws to prevent loosening due to vibrations.

## Step 2: Mounting Motors

1. Attach brushless motors to each armâ€™s motor mounts.
2. Secure motors firmly using the supplied screws.
3. Ensure motor shafts are free to rotate without obstruction.

## Step 3: Installing the Power Distribution Board (PDB)

1. Mount the PDB at the designated location on the frame using standoffs.
2. Verify proper isolation from metal frame parts to prevent shorts.

## Step 4: Flight Controller Installation

1. Attach the flight controller atop the PDB with vibration-damping mounts.
2. Ensure the orientation matches the software configuration (front facing forward).

## Step 5: Wiring Routing

1. Route wires neatly along the arms and frame.
2. Use zip ties or cable clips to secure wiring and prevent snagging.

## Step 6: Propeller Installation

1. Install propellers, ensuring the correct rotation direction on each motor.
2. Secure propellers with provided nuts and safety washers.

## Step 7: Final Checks

1. Inspect all mechanical connections.
2. Verify no loose parts or wires.
3. Confirm center of gravity is balanced.
