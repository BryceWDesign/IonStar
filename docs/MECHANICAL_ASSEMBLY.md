# IonStar Mechanical Assembly Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for physically assembling the IonStar drone frame, motors, and associated hardware.

## 1. Frame Preparation

- Unpack all frame components.
- Identify main frame plate, arms, motor mounts, and hardware bags.
- Inspect all parts for damage or defects.

## 2. Assemble Arms to Frame

- Align each arm with the corresponding mounting holes on the main frame plate.
- Secure arms using provided M3 screws and lock nuts.
- Use a torque driver to tighten screws evenly; avoid overtightening.

## 3. Mount Motors

- Attach brushless motors to the motor mounts on each arm.
- Use M4 screws and lock washers to secure motors.
- Ensure motor shafts face upward and spin freely.
- Connect motor wires, routing them neatly along arms.

## 4. Install Landing Gear

- Attach landing gear legs to the bottom of the frame using M3 screws.
- Confirm landing gear is stable and level.

## 5. Mount Electronics Tray

- Secure the electronics mounting tray to the center of the frame.
- Use vibration dampening mounts (rubber grommets) between the tray and frame.
- Verify mounting holes align with flight controller and PDB.

## 6. Secure Flight Controller and PDB

- Attach flight controller and power distribution board (PDB) to the electronics tray.
- Use nylon standoffs and screws to isolate from vibrations.
- Connect wiring harnesses according to wiring guide.

## 7. Propeller Installation (Post Electronics Testing)

- Only install propellers after successful electronic system testing.
- Attach propellers with correct rotation direction per motor.
- Tighten propeller nuts securely but do not overtighten.

## 8. Final Checks

- Inspect all screws and connectors.
- Ensure no wiring is pinched or loose.
- Perform balance check of assembled drone.
